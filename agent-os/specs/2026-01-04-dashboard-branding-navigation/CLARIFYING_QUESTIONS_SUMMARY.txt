CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR USER
==============================
Dashboard Branding & Navigation Cleanup Spec

PRIORITY ORDER FOR ASKING:

1. DASHBOARD HEADER REPLACEMENT (Most Important - Drives Design)
   Current: Sticky header shows Barangay Mawaque logo + "Barangay Mawaque" text + "Digital Services" subtitle

   What should replace this?
   a) Remove header entirely (less visual clutter)
   b) Keep logo only (neutral branding)
   c) Replace with generic "Digital Services" or "Linkod App" text
   d) Add multi-barangay selector (for nationwide deployments)
   e) Other preference?

---

2. BOTTOM NAVIGATION CONFIRMATION (Simple Yes/No)
   Current: 5 buttons (Home, Services, Requests, News, Profile)
   Proposal: Simplify to 3 buttons (Home, News, Profile)
   Reason: Services is redundant (same as Home), Requests is on dashboard tabs

   Should we remove Services and Requests buttons?
   (Simple yes/no confirmation)

---

3. REQUESTS ACCESS PATH (Clarifies Your Guidance)
   Currently: Users can access requests via dashboard tab OR bottom nav button
   You said: "requests section on home dashboard is sufficient"

   After removing bottom nav button, expect users to:
   a) Use only dashboard "Requests" tab
   b) Keep dashboard tab AND direct /requests URL access for bookmarks
   c) Other approach?

---

4. REPORT FOOTER BRANDING (Staff Portal Consistency)
   Current: PDF reports have "Barangay Mawaque Digital Services" footer

   Should this be:
   a) Removed entirely
   b) Changed to generic "Digital Services"
   c) Made configurable per deployment/barangay
   d) Other preference?

---

5. LOGO FILE HANDLING (Visual Identity)
   Current: Dashboard uses /images/logo.png (Mawaque-specific)

   Should it:
   a) Be removed (no logo in header)
   b) Use neutral logo (Linkod app logo instead)
   c) Be configurable per deployment
   d) Other preference?

---

6. MULTI-BARANGAY ARCHITECTURE (Future Scalability)
   Context: App transitioning to nationwide deployment

   For this change, should we:
   a) Just remove hardcoding, make it generic
   b) Add environment variable support (NEXT_PUBLIC_BARANGAY_NAME, etc.)
   c) Build database configuration support
   d) Decide architecture later, just remove branding now?

---

7. HEADER ADDITIONAL FEATURES (Optional Interaction)
   Simple question: Should the Home button in bottom nav have any special behavior?
   (Multi-click, long-press menu, etc.)
   Or just standard navigation?
