# Clarifying Questions for Dashboard Branding & Navigation Cleanup

Based on research of the codebase, here are key questions to refine the specification:

## 1. Dashboard Header Replacement Strategy

**Current State**: The dashboard header displays a sticky bar with:
- Barangay Mawaque logo image (`/images/logo.png`)
- "Barangay Mawaque" text label
- "Digital Services" subtitle

**Question**: What should replace the "Barangay Mawaque" branding in the dashboard header?

**Options**:
- **A) Remove header entirely** - Just use white space/reduce header height from 60px
- **B) Keep minimal branding** - Logo only (neutral or app-branded logo)
- **C) Generic text replacement** - "Linkod App" or just "Digital Services"
- **D) Multi-barangay selector** - Add location/barangay picker for future nationwide support
- **E) Other approach?**

**Impact**: This header appears on every dashboard view and is the first visual element users see.

## 2. Home Button Behavior and Placement

**Current State**: The bottom navigation has redundancy:
- "Home" button → `/dashboard`
- "Services" button → `/dashboard` (DUPLICATE)
- "Requests" button → `/requests` (will remove)

**Question**: After removing Services and Requests buttons, what should the Home button do?

- **A) Point to dashboard** - Current behavior (shows services/requests/payments tabs)
- **B) Additional functionality** - Long-press menu, or multi-click behavior?
- **C) Different starting tab** - Should it default to Services or something else?

## 3. Requests Access Pattern Confirmation

**Current State**: Users can access requests in multiple ways:
1. **Dashboard tab**: On home dashboard, "Requests" tab shows all requests
2. **Dedicated page**: Clicking "Requests" tab navigates to `/requests` page
3. **Bottom nav button**: Direct access to `/requests` (will remove)

**Your input**: "The requests section on home dashboard is sufficient"

**Question**: After removing the bottom nav button, what's the expected user flow?
- **A) Via dashboard only** - Users click Requests tab on dashboard, then navigate via the page tabs
- **B) Multiple entry points** - Keep dashboard tab access AND `/requests` direct URL access
- **C) Dashboard primary, URL secondary** - Dashboard is preferred, but bookmarked `/requests` URLs should still work

## 4. Report Branding (Staff Portal Documents)

**Current State**: PDF reports generated in staff dashboard footer include:
- Hardcoded text: "Barangay Mawaque Digital Services"
- Used in documents generated by `app/staff/reports/page.tsx`

**Question**: How should PDF footer branding be handled for nationwide deployment?
- **A) Remove footer text entirely** - Just have empty footer
- **B) Generic text** - Replace with "Digital Services" or app name
- **C) Configurable per deployment** - Load barangay name from environment or database
- **D) Operator's barangay** - Show logged-in staff member's assigned barangay

## 5. Logo File and Branding Assets

**Current State**: Dashboard header uses `/images/logo.png` (Barangay Mawaque specific logo).

**Question**: How should logo branding be handled?
- **A) Remove logo** - No image in header
- **B) Neutral logo** - Use Linkod app logo instead (`/images/linkod-app-logo-main.png`)
- **C) Configurable** - Make logo path configurable per deployment
- **D) Generic placeholder** - Use a generic "linkod" or "barangay services" icon

---

## 6. Future Multi-Barangay Architecture

**Context**: App is transitioning to support multiple barangays nationwide.

**Question**: Should we build configuration support into this change?
- **A) Generic now, config later** - Make it work for any barangay without hardcoding
- **B) Environment variables** - Support `NEXT_PUBLIC_BARANGAY_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGO_URL`
- **C) Database configuration** - Store branding in database, configurable per deployment
- **D) User context** - Show different branding based on logged-in user's barangay
- **E) Keep flexible, decide later** - Just remove hardcoding for now

## 7. Navigation Simplification Confirmation

**Proposed bottom navigation** (reduce from 5 to 3 items):

| Action | Current | Proposed | Reason |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Home | Keep | Keep | Primary entry point |
| Services | Keep | **REMOVE** | Redundant - same as Home |
| Requests | Keep | **REMOVE** | Accessible via dashboard tab |
| News | Keep | Keep | Announcements section |
| Profile | Keep | Keep | User profile section |

**Question**: Is this navigation structure correct?
- **A) Yes, proceed** - Remove Services and Requests buttons
- **B) Keep Requests button** - Keep direct access to requests
- **C) Different structure** - Suggest alternative navigation items
- **D) Keep Services button** - For some specific reason?

## Summary for Orchestration

These 7 questions should be presented to the user to clarify:

1. **Header replacement approach** (most important design decision)
2. **Home button behavior** (interaction pattern)
3. **Requests access flow** (confirms user journey)
4. **Report branding strategy** (staff portal consistency)
5. **Logo/asset handling** (visual identity)
6. **Multi-barangay support** (future scalability)
7. **Navigation confirmation** (final UI confirmation)

**Priority order for asking**:
1. Question #1 (header) - drives visual design
2. Question #7 (nav confirmation) - simple yes/no
3. Question #3 (requests flow) - clarifies your statement
4. Question #2 (home behavior) - interaction detail
5. Question #4 (reports) - staff portal consistency
6. Question #5 (logo) - branding consistency
7. Question #6 (architecture) - future-proofing
