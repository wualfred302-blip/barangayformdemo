## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
Residents across the Philippines face significant friction when accessing barangay services:

1. **Manual Paperwork Burden** - Certificate requests, permits, and documents require extensive manual processing and physical form completion
2. **Time-Consuming In-Person Visits** - Residents must physically visit the barangay office during business hours, taking time away from work and family
3. **Inefficient Service Delivery** - Barangay staff lack organized systems for managing requests, tracking status, and prioritizing urgent matters
4. **Lack of Digital Identity** - No standardized digital identity system for residents at the barangay level
5. **Poor Service Accessibility** - Limited access to services for residents with mobility issues, time constraints, or who live far from the barangay office
6. **Lack of Transparency** - Limited visibility into service status and processing times

### Impact
- Residents waste hours on paperwork and travel
- Barangay staff work inefficiently with manual systems
- Services remain underutilized due to accessibility barriers
- Communities lack organized channels for reporting issues
